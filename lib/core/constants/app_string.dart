I further agree not to initiate any claims or legal proceedings against any third party that might seek contribution or indemnity from Miracle Experience or its affiliated entities.

I confirm that I, along with any individuals included in my booking or under my care, am in appropriate physical, mental, and medical condition to participate in the flight. I acknowledge that this activity carries inherent risks, which may include, but are not limited to: hard or uneven landings, abrupt changes in weather, unforeseen encounters with wildlife, or mechanical malfunction — any of which, in rare instances, could result in injury, loss of property, or fatality.

I understand and acknowledge that pregnant women are not permitted to fly, and this policy is communicated at the time of booking and on all issued tickets or flight vouchers. Should I or someone under my care choose to participate in violation of this policy—whether due to non-disclosure or oversight—I accept full responsibility for any associated risks or consequences.
